# MoveIt 6DOF Robot Controller

This repository provides a **MoveIt! package** designed for controlling a 6DOF robotic manipulator.  
It focuses on planning and executing motion trajectories to control the **end-effector pose** with precision.  

---

## ðŸš€ Overview
- Developed a custom MoveIt! package for a 6DOF robotic arm.  
- Implemented end-effector pose control using motion planning algorithms such as **RRTConnect**.  
- Simulated the full robot control pipeline within a **ROS + MoveIt! environment**.  
- Added a custom **C++ control node (`pose_controller.cpp`)** to send pose commands to the robot.
